Bunny Moon
====

Mission statement

My first attempt at a simple 2d platformer using the Unity game engine.

A little bunny has a dream of reaching the moon...
There will be platforms leading upwards to the moon in a narrow passageway with tall walls on either side. These platforms can be still or be moving horizontally/vertically. As the bunny goes up and up, there will be windows with a ledge along the walls. Each window has a different colored light shining from within. If the bunny gets curious enough to look into the windows, it'll see a room with a giant fruit of that color floating inside. There is a star sitting on top of the fruit in each room, and it can only be reached by flying up there. Wings can be obtained by consuming certain collectibles scattered on the platforms. If the bunny manages to collect at least 5 stars, it'll be able to feed them to the rainbow-farting narwhal in the last room at the top of the walled passageway. The satiated narwhal will then give the bunny a ride to the moon, just as the bunny had dreamed. The end!

A simple game with a simple story, and my first steps to get better at coding...?
